# GraphQL Servlet

Implementation of GraphQL Java Servlet including support for Relay.js, Apollo and OSGi out of the box.
This project wraps the Java implementation of GraphQL provided by [GraphQL Java](https://www.graphql-java.com).
See [GraphQL Java documentation](https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/latest/) for more in depth details
regarding GraphQL Java itself. 

We try to stay up to date with GraphQL Java as much as possible. The current version supports **GraphQL Java 14.0**.
 
This project requires at least Java 8.

## Installation and getting started

See [Getting started](https://www.graphql-java-kickstart.com/servlet/getting-started/) for more detailed instructions.
